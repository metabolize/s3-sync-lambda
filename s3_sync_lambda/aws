# Note:
# This file is installed into the bin directory of the virtualenv by awscli.  We
# currently don't do anything with the virtualenv's bin directory in the lambda
# build, which means the file doesn't end up in the lambda. As a workaround, the
# file is vendored in here.
# 
# If we don't want to vendor in this file, an alternative would be to change the
# lambda build so the virtualenv bin directory is copied e.g. into the lambda
# build.
